00:00.000 --> 00:02.920
Today is going to be not just listening to me,

00:02.920 --> 00:05.480
but it's going to be participative.

00:05.480 --> 00:06.920
And we're going to start.

00:06.920 --> 00:07.440
It's not hard.

00:07.440 --> 00:08.880
Some of you are looking at each other going, oh, no,

00:08.880 --> 00:10.760
what's he going to make me do?

00:10.760 --> 00:11.360
Pretty simple.

00:11.360 --> 00:14.200
I'd like you all to read this sentence.

00:14.200 --> 00:17.200
And what's more important to me than the meaning of the sentence

00:17.200 --> 00:21.160
is I'd like for you to count the number of F's, the letter F.

00:21.160 --> 00:22.800
How many F's do you find?

00:22.800 --> 00:25.160
I'll give you three or four seconds to do it.

00:25.160 --> 00:27.800
Keep the answer quiet to yourself.

00:27.800 --> 00:29.000
How many F's?

00:30.800 --> 00:33.320
I wish my MBA students were as quiet and thoughtful

00:33.320 --> 00:34.400
as you are right now.

00:38.000 --> 00:38.520
All right.

00:38.520 --> 00:40.520
Shhh.

00:40.520 --> 00:40.760
All right.

00:40.760 --> 00:42.240
Raise your hand if you found three F's.

00:42.240 --> 00:43.520
How many found three?

00:43.520 --> 00:43.880
Excellent.

00:43.880 --> 00:44.200
Very good.

00:44.200 --> 00:45.720
Anybody find four?

00:45.720 --> 00:47.720
Ah, anybody found five?

00:47.720 --> 00:49.040
How about six?

00:49.040 --> 00:51.160
There are six F's.

00:51.160 --> 00:58.160
What two letter words ending in F did many of us miss?

00:58.200 --> 01:00.400
So why do I do this activity?

01:00.400 --> 01:03.600
I have done this in every workshop, every keynote, I-
