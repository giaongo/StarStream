## Features
- **Custom-built Streaming Server**: A fast and secured streaming server holding full control over the configuration and functionalities.
- **Today Event Streaming**: The users can track today events with timing and scheduling.
- **Real-time Event Broadcasting**: The users can watch the live streaming broadcasted from the Nokia event venue. The streamings are performed by the Nokia staff, given the security streaming information provided for the admin in the solution.

3. AWS S3
4. AWS CDN

## Installation Instructions 
### For Development Purposes:
1. Create a list of envs:
* In backend folder:  Create an .env inside the backend directory with the below format. Create a data field freely on your own:<br/>
APP_SECRET=\
POSTGRES_USER=\
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=\
POSTGRES_DB=\
ADMIN_EMAIL=\
ADMIN_PASSWORD=\
JWT_SECRET=<br/>

* In nms folder: Create an .env inside the nms directory with the below format.
Refer to AWS documentation to create a user in AWS and get the necessary accesskey and key id. More information can be found in [AWS SDK Info](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v3/developer-guide/getting-started-nodejs.html) <br/>
AWS_BUCKET_NAME=\
AWS_ACCESSKEYID=\
AWS_SECRETACCESSKEY=\
AWS_REGION=<br/>

* In videochat folder: Create an .env inside the videochat directory with the below format.
Refer to [KDB.AI](https://code.kx.com/kdbai/latest/index.html) and [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/prompts/new_chat) <br/>
KDB_ENDPOINT_URL=\
KDB_API_KEY=\
GOOGLE_API_KEY=<br/>

2. Ensure that Docker is installed in your computer.
3. Open command prompt and go to main directory where docker-compose.yaml locates
4. Run docker containers (Depending on your computer resources, this process may take quite long): `docker-compose up --build`
5. Stop and remove docker containers(This clears out the running containers and network resources): `docker-compose down`
6. **DEBUG:** Get into the docker database for further inspection: `docker exec -ti postgresql psql -U streamuser -d starstream_db`
7. **DEV:** When there are fronend code changes, frontend react auto-reloads the frontend container
8. **DEV:** When changes need to be made in backend, nms, and videochat -> manual restarting container is necessary by: `docker-compose restart backend`
9. **DEV:** If you want to remove the persistent volume of postgres database: `docker volume rm  starstream_persist-volume`
